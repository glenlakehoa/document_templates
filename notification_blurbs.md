## Due dates for the annual assessment

Attention all homeowners,

Please be advised that the annual HOA fee of $800 can be paid in two installments.

The first installment must be at least $400 and is due on January 1st, 2024 with a ten-day grace period, ending on Wednesday, January 10th, 2024 at 5:00 PM.

The remaining balance of the HOA fee must be paid by July 1st, 2024 with a ten-day grace period, ending on Wednesday, July 10th, 2024 at 5:00 PM.

Please note that the Hinson office is not open on weekends. Payments can be made by mail or in person at the Hinson office during business hours.

## Assessment remainder due on July 1st

A gentle reminder for the people who chose the option to pay half of the assessment in the beginning of the year:

The remainder of the assessment is due on July 1st. There is a grace period until Monday July 10th, 5:00pm. Payments after this date/time are considered delinquent and will be subject to a $25 late fee and interest. This includes payments deposited in Hinson's mailbox after the close of business on July 10th.

# Meetings

## HOA Budget Meetings

The Homeowners Association is inviting homeowners to attend the upcoming budget meetings on September 19 at 6:30pm (club house) or September 23 at 11:00am (patio deck of the community swimming pool).

This is your chance to learn about how the HOA plans to invest in improving the neighborhood and to provide feedback on the proposed budget for the upcoming year. Your input is important to ensure that the HOA budget meets the needs of the community.
